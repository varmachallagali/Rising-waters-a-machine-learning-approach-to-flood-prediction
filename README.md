# Rising-waters-a-machine-learning-approach-to-flood-prediction
This project develops a machine learning model to predict flood risk using environmental data such as rainfall, river levels, temperature, and humidity. By analyzing historical patterns, the system classifies flood probability and supports early warning systems to reduce damage and improve disaster response.
